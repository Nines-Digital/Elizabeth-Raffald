<h1>Elizabeth raffald</h1>
<p class="p">This is page will be used to give you the basic details of Elizabeth Raffald.</p>

<div>The Experienced English Housekeeper of 18th Century Manchester, a woman of drive and character. Elizabeth lived at the dawn of the Industrial Age. Her name is unfamiliar to most Mancunians and yet she was a powerhouse of hard work and entrepreneurialism, something for which Manchester has always been renowned. She was a skilled confectionery cook, writer and businesswoman who lived in Manchester from 1763 , when she married at the age of 30, until she died in 1781. In that short time she produced a definitive cookbook and the first trade directory for Manchester, financed newspapers, wrote a book on midwifery and yet still found time to have a family. After a varied career she was buried at Stockport and her husband fled to London. Hers is a fascinating story taking in many things and places, including Arley Hall in Cheshire, Kersal Moor racecourse and the Eccles cake. She is a woman who deserves to be remembered for her contribution to Manchester.</div>
